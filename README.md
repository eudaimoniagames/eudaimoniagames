# Welcome to Eudaimonia Games!

Our favorite part of gaming is reaching that flow state where the player feels almost possessed by the game. Our name reflects this engaging, satisfying state of being.

The word [eudaimonia/εὐδαιμονία](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia) (you-die-moan-ee-uh) originates from Ancient Greek, literally translating to "the state or condition of good spirit." Breakdown:
- Prefix - [eu-/εὖ-](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/eu-) (you): Ancient Greek prefix meaning "well, good."
- Root - [daimon/δαίμων](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daimon) (die-moan): Despite this word ultimately becoming "demon" in our modern lexicon, it originally is thought to have had positive connotation. In Ancient Greek philosophical tradition, a daimon is an invisible guiding spirit of a past hero/genius.
- Suffix - [-ia/-ία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek) (ee-uh): Ancient Greek, added to the stems of adjectives to form abstract nouns.

Get possessed! Eudaimonia for all!
